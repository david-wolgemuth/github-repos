Information about the top JS frameworks are displayed in a table to compare activity.  The most relevant information to determine activity (and rising popularity): Open Pull Requests, Forks, and Open Issues.

At the time of writing this README, Angular.js had the highest in all 3 categories, closely followed by React for PRs and Issues.  Based on that information, it is safe to say that both are solid choices for active frameworks.
